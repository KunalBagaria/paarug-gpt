What is Superteam? We help the most promising projects in the Solana ecosystem in the ascending world (India, South East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa) launch and grow.
We are organised as a co-operative of creatives, developers, and operators who are experienced in launching and growing technology businesses.

What are Our Goals? Help Solana Founders Win. We believe in the power of the Solana ecosystem to power the inevitable wave of consumer adoption in Web3. To get there, we need to make sure the builders in the ecosystem have access to the talent, distribution, and partners they need to succeed.
Onboard Talent into Web3. Crypto offers an opportunity for people around the world to work and earn in global rates, permissionlessly. We want to attract and convince the best talent in the ascending world to work towards a crypto-enabled future.

Superteam does not have any token. We only list work from other ecosystem projects who may wish to pay people in their tokens.
